# AFtheM configuration templates

AFtheM is a modular open source microgateway that simplifies the creation of complex flows.

As the microgateway can be used in various ways, some of which quite intricated, this repository was created to present some unusual, self-contained sample configurations.

## AFtheM databases

AFtheM can be used to connect to databases using HTTP APIs. [This project](https://github.com/apifortress/afthem-templates/tree/master/afthem_databases) describes how this is achiveved.

## AFtheM Forward API

AFtheM is particularly good to debug APIs. [This project](https://github.com/apifortress/afthem-templates/tree/master/afthem_forward_api)
shows to capture API conversations and forward them to an HTTP endpoint.

## AFtheM Live Testing API

[API response-forwarding example](https://github.com/apifortress/afthem-templates/tree/master/afthem_fortress_live_testing) for the [API Fortress](https://apifortress.com) live testing API.

## AFtheM Tunnelling
