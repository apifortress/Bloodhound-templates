# Bloodhound configuration templates

Bloodhound is a modular open source microgateway that simplifies the creation of complex flows.

As the microgateway can be used in various ways, some of which quite intricated, this repository was created to present some unusual, self-contained sample configurations.

## Bloodhound databases

Bloodhound can be used to connect to databases using HTTP APIs. [This project](https://github.com/apifortress/afthem-templates/tree/master/afthem_databases) describes how this is achiveved.

## Bloodhound Forward API

Bloodhound is particularly good to debug APIs. [This project](https://github.com/apifortress/afthem-templates/tree/master/afthem_forward_api)
shows to capture API conversations and forward them to an HTTP endpoint.

## Bloodhound Live Testing API

## Bloodhound Tunnelling
